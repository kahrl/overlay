This is my personal gentoo portage overlay.

Everything in here is highly experimental. I reserve the right to break
your systems and/or change the ebuilds in any way at any time. I also
reverse the right to do absolutely nothing. Anyway, if you're using
third-party ebuilds written by some dude on the internet and don't read
them before installing, don't blame me if something breaks :-)

May contain traces of nuts, gluten, simian, or milk.


To install, emerge layman and add the following to /var/lib/layman/my-list.xml
(or wherever you have the list of additional repositories to be; if it
already exists, only add the part between <repo></repo>, inclusive):
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE repositories SYSTEM "/dtd/repositories.dtd">
<repositories xmlns="" version="1.0">
  <repo quality="experimental" status="unofficial">
    <name><![CDATA[kahrl]]></name>
    <description><![CDATA[kahrl's experimental overlay]]></description>
    <homepage>http://github.com/kahrl/overlay/tree/master</homepage>
    <owner>
      <email>kahrl@gmx.net</email>
      <name><![CDATA[Kahrl]]></name>
    </owner>
    <source type="git">git://github.com/kahrl/overlay.git</source>
    <feed>http://github.com/feeds/kahrl/commits/overlay/master</feed>
  </repo>
</repositories>

Once you've done that, change layman's overlays setting and add
/var/lib/layman/my-list.xml to your /etc/layman/layman.cfg, like this:
overlays  : http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/overlays/repositories.xml
            file:///var/lib/layman/my-list.xml

Then layman -a kahrl should take care of adding the overlay.
